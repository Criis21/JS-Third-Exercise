1. Create a function that orders the sequence array from smallest to largest.
2. Create a function that orders the sequence array from highest to lowest.
3. Create a function that calculates the arithmetic mean of the data in the Sequence array.
4. The calculation of the letter of the National Identity Document (DNI) is a simple mathematical process that is based on obtaining the rest of the entire division of the DNI number and the number 23. From the rest of the division, the letter is obtained selecting it within an array of letters. The array of letters is: Therefore, if the rest of the division is 0, the letter of the DNI is T and if the rest is 3 the letter is A. With these data, create a small script that: - Store in a variable the DNI number indicated by the user and in another variable the letter of the DNI that has been indicated. First of all, you must check if the number is less than 0 or greater than 99999999. If this is the case, a message is displayed to the user indicating that the number provided is invalid and the program does not display any more messages. If the number is valid, the corresponding letter is calculated according to the method explained above. Once the letter has been calculated, it must be compared with the letter indicated by the user. If they do not match, a message is displayed to the user telling him that the letter he has indicated is not correct. Otherwise, a message is displayed indicating that the DNI number and letter are correct.
